While having a constant nucleotide sequence DNA molecules in a cell can be chemically modified in a number of different ways.
For example, the DNA bases can be methylated, or histone proteins, around which DNA is wrapped, can be supplied with chemical
tags such as acetylation. It is thought that such modifications (or marks) define cell specialization or a cell state when a
certain combination of marks regulate how genes are expressed.

In this problem, you are given genomic tracks describing a presence or an absence of several epigenomic marks. Your task is
to split the genomic positions into a number of states so that each state corresponds to a particular combination of marks.
