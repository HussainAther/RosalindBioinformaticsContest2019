While having a constant nucleotide sequence DNA molecules in a cell can be chemically modified in a number of different
ways. For example, the DNA bases can be methylated, or histone proteins, around which DNA is wrapped, can be supplied
with chemical tags such as acetylation. It is thought that such modifications (or marks) define cell specialization
or a cell state when a certain combination of marks regulate how genes are expressed.
